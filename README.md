 Performance artist touring assistant


 Tour Like Bettye is an app that guides fledgling performing artists toward their greatest performance by assisting with the search of great places to play based on venues that proved successful starting points for seasoned performing artists. 
 
 The app has a visitor named a User that creates an account which includes a user name and password. The user can then access a list of venues from which they will choose tourdates. 
 
 These tourdates become the customized tour they can research and create contacts and notes about the venues found herein. The user has access to editing their personal account details, editing the chosen venues, and adding/editing custom venues not found in the master list of venues. 
 
 Once the user has made a few selections, they then can manage their tour with the details about each venue and the progress theyâ€™ve made toward contacting the venues for a performance contract.

At time of this writing, the requirements for this final project have been met, despite not coding all or some of the features list above.
